## Image Classification:

## 􏰀 Objective: Build a model to classify images into different categories.

􏰀 Description: Use a labeled dataset of images (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST) to train a

deep learning model that can classify images into predefined categories.

## 􏰀 Key Steps:

o Data augmentation and preprocessing (e.g., normalization, resizing) o Building a convolutional neural network (CNN)

o Training the model with a training dataset

o Model evaluation and fine-tuning using a validation dataset

o Handling overfitting with techniques like dropout and regularization
